GMR Switch smart chessboard with Arduino Mega and PCM speech synthesis.
Reads an 8 x 8 array of AD024 GMR magnetic switches.
Displays the move times and moves in algebraic notation and speaks the move in descriptive notation using PCM audio. 
A0-A7 (Port F) is sensor select (ranks/rows) connected to VDDs; A8-A15 (Port K) reads sensor outputs (files/columns).
SDA and SCL connect to a 20 x 4 LCD Module. P10 (OC2A) is PCM audio.
